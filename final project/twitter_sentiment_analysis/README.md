# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiments of tweets collected from Twitter using the Twitter API. The dataset contains 1,600,000 tweets labeled with sentiment annotations (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive). The goal is to design a classification model that accurately predicts the polarity of the tweets based on their content.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises the following fields:

1. **target**: The polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive).
2. **ids**: The unique ID of the tweet.
3. **date**: The date and time the tweet was posted (e.g., Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009).
4. **flag**: The query associated with the tweet. If no query exists, the value is `NO_QUERY`.
5. **user**: The username of the person who tweeted.
6. **text**: The content of the tweet.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can predict the sentiment of tweets based on the text content. The model should correctly identify whether a tweet is positive, neutral, or negative.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load and examine the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Perform basic text preprocessing to clean the tweet content, such as removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenize the text and convert it to numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or Word Embeddings.
   - Handle imbalanced classes, if necessary, using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose classification models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like LSTM and CNN.
   - Train the models on the training data and fine-tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare different models to identify the one with the best performance.

5. **Model Interpretation**:
   - Analyze feature importance to understand which words or phrases contribute most to each sentiment class.
   - Visualize the model's predictions with confusion matrices and ROC curves.
